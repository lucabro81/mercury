The README walks through setting up the Chat app step by step (gcloud wherever it can, the two Cloud Console pages field by field) and creates the Pub/Sub subscription with no expiration. A new section covers a subscription Pub/Sub deleted after 31 idle days: how to recreate it and give the service account its role back.
