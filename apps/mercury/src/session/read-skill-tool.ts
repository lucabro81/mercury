/**
 * Model-invocable loader for a plugin's Agent Skill body — the "load" half of
 * the discover-then-load shape SKILL.md introduces. The system prompt carries
 * only each skill's name and one-line description (see `buildSystemPrompt`);
 * when a request matches one, the model calls this to pull the skill's full
 * instructions into context, exactly as it calls a CLI's `--help` rather than
 * carrying every flag in the prompt. Same `tool()`-wrapping split as
 * `tool-log-recall-tool.ts` and `wiki-tools.ts`.
 *
 * Registered by the composition root only when at least one skill loaded, so an
 * instance with no skills never exposes an empty tool.
