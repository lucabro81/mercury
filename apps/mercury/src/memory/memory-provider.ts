/**
 * The memory-provider seam (issue #4, built ahead of the broader #30

 * exchange after it happens, and contributing its own recall tools — kept
 * behind a small interface so the composition root wires it like any
 * other provider rather than hardwiring it into the pipeline. Only the two
 * hooks #4 exercises live here; the wider generalization (priming,
 * summarizer, wiki strategy as swappable providers) is deferred to #30.
 *
 * The one implementation today is the verbatim archive
 * (`./verbatim-archive-store.ts`).
