/**
 * The `present` tool: the model's explicit "show this artifact to the user"
 * action. A tool that produced a user-facing `display` stashed it in the
 * `DisplayStore` (see `display-store.ts`) and returned a `ref` on the model
 * channel; the model never sees the rendered content, only the ref. Calling
 * `present(ref)` marks that ref to be appended to the reply at finalize.
 *
 * This is what shrinks the model's job from "format this list correctly"
 * (which small models garble) to "show this list? yes/no": the artifact is
 * always the deterministic one the formatter produced, and the model only
 * decides whether it appears. If the model never calls `present`, nothing is
 * shown — the right outcome for a "how many are open?" question answered in
 * prose. Scoped to the calling session, so it can only surface its own refs.
