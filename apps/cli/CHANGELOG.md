# @mercury-fw/cli

## 0.26.0

### Minor Changes

- 8b92abb: - `mfw` operates an app from inside its folder: `start`, `stop` and `restart` (with `--no-cache`), `logs`, `repl`, `shell`, all as `docker compose` calls.
  - `mfw vault` maintains the wiki vault (`list`, `read`, `grep`, `write-curated`, `write-raw`) in a one-off container.
  - `mfw memory list` and `mfw memory read <collection>` read the memory on Qdrant, newest first where the collection has a timestamp index.
  - `mfw reset memory` and `mfw reset wiki` delete a memory volume after you type the app's name, then bring the service back up empty; after a memory reset a running app is restarted, so it sets up its collections again.
  - The command line is declared with commander: `--help` at every level, a suggestion for a mistyped command, and every argument checked before anything runs.
  - A scaffolded app lists `@mercury-fw/cli` among its devDependencies, at the framework's version, and its README runs it through `bunx mfw`.
  - A scaffolded app's `@types/bun` and `typescript` use caret ranges instead of exact versions.
  - The core ships a read-only memory CLI (`src/memory/memory-cli.ts`) next to the vault one, which is what `mfw memory` runs.
  - The vault CLI says so when asked to read a note that doesn't exist, instead of printing a stack trace.

## 0.25.1

### Patch Changes

- 5613e5e: - Mercury starts even when Qdrant isn't answering yet: the memory collections are set up in the background and retried until Qdrant is reachable, instead of crashing the process at startup.
  - A new session's context primer goes on without the last-session recap when Qdrant doesn't answer, instead of failing the turn.
  - The scaffolded app's `docker-compose.yml` restarts the app service unless it was stopped.
