/**
 * Emits each public workspace's type declarations into its `dist/`, in
 * dependency order, for publishing. The packages ship their TypeScript source
 * (Bun runs it as is); the declarations are what an app's `tsc` reads instead,
 * so it never type-checks the framework's internals against whatever versions
 * the app happened to resolve. `dist/` is not committed.
 *
 * Each package is built with a throwaway tsconfig that extends its own, leaves
 * the tests and the postinstall scripts out, and drops the `mercury-fw-source`
 * condition: its `@mercury-fw/*` imports then resolve to the declarations just
 * emitted for those packages, not to their source.
 *
 * Run from the repo root: `bun scripts/build-types.ts`.
