/**
 * Deterministic post-processor for a `jira issue search` result — the
 * *extraction* half of Jira's issue-list handling. It recognizes the shape of a
 * search result and emits, on the user-facing `display` channel (see
 * `ToolDisplay`, `type: "issue-list"`), one **structured record** per issue
 * (`{ key, status, summary, url }`) — never a pre-rendered string. Turning those
 * records into text is the instance's formatter rule for `issue-list`, written
 * in its config; the plugin owns only what it can know from the data: the
 * fields, and the browse `url` resolved from `siteUrl`.
 *
 * It is the plugin's single post-processor, so it runs after every allowed
 * command and acts only when the matched prefix is `issue search`, passing
 * every other result through untouched. `--select` can reshape the JSON into anything, so
 * it classifies defensively: a non-object payload passes through untouched; a
 * payload with no `issues` array, or issues pruned of `key` or `summary`, keeps
 * its data and gets a model-facing `formattedListNote` (no display). Every
 * result with an `issues` array also gets `issueCount`, that page's length.
 * `siteUrl` (the team's browsable Jira host) isn't derivable from any CLI
 * output, so it's a deployment constant carried in the plugin's config;
 * without it the extractor emits no `display`, the rest stays.
 *
 * `CliResult`/`CliPostProcessor` come from `@mercury-fw/plugin-types`, the shared
 * contract both the core and the plugins import.
