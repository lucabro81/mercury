/**
 * The wiki self-review cron: runs once nightly (a fixed local hour,
 * hardcoded, no env override — deliberately different from every other
 * interval in this codebase, per an explicit request to keep this one
 * out of runtime configurability), running raw/ triage, index.md/orphan
 * maintenance, and a contradiction check as three independent sub-passes
 * (see `self-review-runner.ts` for why they're independent, not one
 * multi-step call). Raw-triage and index/orphan each skip when their own
 * cheap pre-check finds nothing to do; the contradiction check has no
 * such pre-check and always runs on a triggered tick — running the whole
 * thing at night, when nothing else contends for the shared local model,
 * is what makes that affordable.
 *
 * This file owns only the scheduling/orchestration mechanics — vault
 * access and the actual LLM calls are injected, same separation
 * `idle-session-cron.ts` uses for session storage and the LLM summarizer.
