/**
 * Constructs the Ollama provider Mercury uses for every LLM call (main
 * agent turns and Layer 1 summarization alike).
 *
 * Why it exists: the Ollama endpoint Mercury talks to varies by
 * deployment (a local GPU box in development, a different host in
 * production) and must always come from configuration, never be
 * hardcoded or silently defaulted to `localhost` — this is the single
 * place that reads that configuration, so the fail-fast behavior only
 * has to be correct once.
 *
 * Used by: `src/index.ts` (wiring), which passes the resulting
 * provider's model instance into `createSummarizer` (src/session/summarizer.ts)
 * and `runTurn` (src/session/agent-turn.ts).
